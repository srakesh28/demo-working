# Azure Arm Templates IaaSv2 - Deploy N number of Linux VM's from custom VHD image
<html>

This Azure Arm Template deploys n number of Ubuntu VM's and assumes following is in place

Onetime steps:

a)	Create a  resource group, Storage account , vnet, and subnet created from UI or CLI

b)	Create a Linux VM from Gallery ( I tried with Ubuntu 14) and customize it as you need, install everything that is required.

c)	Follow this steps to capture this as image:  

https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/blob/master/articles/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-capture-image-resource-manager.md

d)	 Once Image is captured it will be in your storage account  in path as below  (Get this path from UI of Storage Blob  and leave image as is copy the URL) , you will see something like below

https://storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net/system/Microsoft.Compute/Images/vhds/linux-image-name.vhd

* Note its Critical : Image has to be in /system/Microsoft.Compute/Images/vhds/ in this path and in same storage account where you will create copies of new vms.
